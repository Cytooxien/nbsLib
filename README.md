# nbsLib
**nbsLib** is a leightweight library for playing .nbs-files. 

This library serves a reformatted and clean code-base inspired by [xxmicloxx's NoteBlockAPI](https://github.com/xxmicloxx/NoteBlockAPI). Unlike the NoteBlockAPI by xxmicloxx **only 1.16.1 is supported**. The support of multiple versions is not planned and **will not be done**!

> **Important: Please do not contact xxmicloxx for errors with this library!**

## **Examples:**
Examples will follow soon, try to figure it out by yourself by now!
