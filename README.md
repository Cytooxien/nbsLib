# nbsLib
**nbsLib** is a lightweight library for playing .nbs-files. 

This library serves a reformatted and clean code-base inspired by [xxmicloxx's NoteBlockAPI](https://github.com/xxmicloxx/NoteBlockAPI). Unlike the NoteBlockAPI by xxmicloxx **only 1.16.2 is fully supported**.
Since this library is only using the bukkit-api, it may also work with other versions.
(I think 1.12+)

The support of multiple versions **is not intended** and **will not be pursued**!

> **Important: Please do not contact xxmicloxx for errors occurring with this library!**

## **Examples:**
Examples will follow soon, try to figure it out by yourself by now!
